## Employment

Currently unemployed but check about page for earlier employments. Unless you count university studies as a job.

## This semester

This semester I'm studying abroad at Murray State University where I'm taking all CSC classes.

## Future education

I plan on finishing my undergraduate degree back in Denmark and then immediately continue on with a masters degree. So far I don't have any plans on applying for a PHD.
